# Store-Inventory-Manager

The system aims to streamline the management of store inventory by allowing users to add, edit, delete, and display products along with their corresponding details such as name, quantity, price, and category. This ensures accurate and up-to-date stock information for effective inventory control.  To protect sensitive operations, the system incorporates password-based authentication for critical functionalities including item addition, editing, deletion, log viewing, chart generation, and income resetting. This security measure prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only authorized personnel can perform administrative actions. The system maintains a cumulative record of all sales transactions. Each sale updates the total income, which is displayed with the appropriate currency symbol (â‚±) for localization. This enables users to monitor business performance in real-time. For better business insights, the application features graphical representation of sales data. A chart displays the quantity of all sold items, aiding users in identifying trends, demand patterns, and stock movement to make informed restocking decisions. All significant actions within the system, particularly those related to inventory changes and sensitive operations, are logged automatically. This log serves as an audit trail, enhancing accountability and facilitating review in case of discrepancies or user inquiries.
